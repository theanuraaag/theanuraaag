### Hello there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Anurag Bhardwaj but that's not very hard to deduce. I'm currently studying in the Electrical Engineering Department of Delhi Technological University (formerly Delhi College of Engineering).

I'm interested in Web Development and Problem Solving and anything else that is fun, interesting and/or related to tech!

Maybe take a look at some of my repositories?
